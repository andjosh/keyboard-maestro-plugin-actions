# Clean Plain Text with TextSoap

![TextSoap Actions for Keyboard Maestro](https://jaguchi.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/06/014-textsoap_actions1.png)

Clean plain text with a [TextSoap](https://www.unmarked.com/textsoap/) cleaner.

Note that the “Clean Plain Text” version will _not_ retain any formatting in rich text input, even if a clipboard is specified. To keep rich text formatting in tact or to apply rich text cleaners, you must use the “Clean Clipboard with TextSoap” action.

_Requires TextSoap 8._

## Download

Download from the [latest release](https://github.com/mirka/keyboard-maestro-plugin-actions/releases/latest).

## How to use

Put the full name of a TextSoap cleaner in the Cleaner field.

[Text tokens](https://wiki.keyboardmaestro.com/Tokens) can be used in either field.
